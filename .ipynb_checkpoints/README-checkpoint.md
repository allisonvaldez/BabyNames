This is an analysis of the data provided by the United States Social Security Administration. The data details the frequency of baby names from 1880 to present. The project provided experience with:
* data wrangling for loading large datasets to convert it into the proper format.
* exposure to troubleshooting and common problems when working with large data sets.
* exploration of time series analysis.

Moreover, the project provided the oppertunity to gain experience in:
- data visualization to view the proportion of babies with a particular name over time.
