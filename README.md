# Baby Names from 1880-2010

This is an analysis of the data provided by the United States Social Security Administration. The data details the frequency of baby names from 1880 to present day. The project provided experience with data wrangling to load the dataset in the proper format, exposure to troubleshooting and common problems working with large data sets, and exploration of time series analysis. Moreover, the project provided the oppertunity to gain experience in:

- Data visualization to view the proportion of babies with a particular name over time.
- Determining the relative rank of a name over a series of time.
- Determining the most popular and least popular names each year.
- Analyzing trends in names such as: vowels, consonants, length, overall spelling diversity, and placement of first and last letters.
- Analyzing external sources of trends, such as: biblical names, celebrities, and demographic changes.
